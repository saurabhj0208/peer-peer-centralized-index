                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive meive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.

                TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES




The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more
than one control message in a single control communication.

During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is
possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host
will accumulate.  When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent
in a single communication for greatest efficiency.

For receiving, it will be necessary to have a loop which returns to
decode and take action on successive control messages until the control
communication is exhausted.
